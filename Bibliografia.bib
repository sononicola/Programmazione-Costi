	abstract = {Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is a building system based on the use of massive, multi-layered solid wood panels. Although CLT as a construction system has been successful in Europe, only a handful of CLT projects have been built in the U.S. This manuscript presents the results from qualitative research, carried out with the objective of assessing the market potential and barriers to the adoption of CLT in the U.S. Insights from national and international experts were collected using semi-structured interviews. Topics included perceived benefits and disadvantages of CLT as a construction system, major barriers to its adoption in the U.S., and level of awareness about CLT among the architecture community.},

	abstract = {Buildings are products with special environmental characteristics. They are unique in having an indoor environment and uncommon because of the importance of siting and orientation and the usual long life-span of major components. There is a wide variety of instruments for environmental improvement of buildings. Requirement type instruments usually have only a limited scope, though there are some exceptions in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Guidance type instruments tend to be more comprehensive. Scoring instruments are relatively comprehensive but also rather superficial and ad hoc. They require a more solid basis. Instruments based on life cycle analysis (LCA) are as yet deficient with respect to indoor environment, siting and user behaviour, leaving substantial scope for instrument improvement.},
